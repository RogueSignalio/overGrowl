This is a early version of the growler that was intended to be a vue component.

This works for Vue2, but can be modified fairly easily for Vue3.

I just didn't get the point.  We mostly use dynamic css and wanted a global object, so it didn't make sense to require/lock into a framework for this small component.  A question maybe more JS developers should be asking themselves...
